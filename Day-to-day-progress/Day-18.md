# :computer: Day-18 :
:point_right: I added login page which takes input as email and password along with its validation . <br>
:point_right: Steps I followed to make login page :
1. Created a file named as `LoginModel.cs` inside model folder :
```C#

```
2. Created a new action method `Login` inside `Home` controller, we are using `GET`request then we are using `POST` request  :
```C#

```
3. Added `view` with the same action method name Login using create template. 
``` HTML

```
